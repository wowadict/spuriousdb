The archive files are named with the client version number on them. ### represents the client version in the naming scheme.

spurious###.rar   - This is a full database dump in one sql file.
TableDumps###.rar - This is the individual tables dumped in seperate sql files.

Therefore: spurious243.rar would contain the full dump for the 2.4.3 client version.
           TableDumps243.rar would contain the individual tables dump for the 2.4.3 client.

And so on.
